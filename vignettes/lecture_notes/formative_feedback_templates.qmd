# THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COURSEWORK BRIEF

# HOWEVER, IF STUDENTS WANT FORMATIVE FEEDBACK THEY HAVE TO FILL IN ONE OF THE TEMPLATES BELOW


# Formative Feedback Opportunity



Students may request up to **one piece of formative feedback per week** via GitHub pull requests, with at least **one week’s notice** before submission. Feedback will focus on code structure, reproducibility, and analysis interpretation.
