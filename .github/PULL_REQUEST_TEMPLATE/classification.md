## Supervised Classification (Crash Severity)

**Did the author:**

- [ ] Clearly describe the features used and justify their inclusion?
- [ ] Apply appropriate preprocessing (e.g., encoding, missing values)?
- [ ] Choose suitable models (e.g., logistic regression, tree-based methods)?
- [ ] Report and interpret performance metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy, AUC)?

**Strengths:**  
*What was done well.*

**Suggestions:**  
*What could be improved.*
